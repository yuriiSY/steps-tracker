# steps-tracker



#### Objective:
The idea of the application is to give the user the opportunity to count the number of steps taken. The user can start counting steps at any time and any place by simply pressing the start button. If the user wants to pause, he can pause the application or start the counter again using the resume button.


#### Design process:
The application has a simple design, there are 3 screens, one of which is a welcome screen where the user can click on the about button and go to another screen and get acquainted with the application, another option is that the user can enter his name and by clicking on the start button go to the step counting screen where he can already start using the application. There are 2 buttons on the step counting screen, start and reset, by clicking on the start button, the user will start counting steps on the spot, simple shakes and steps taken. The user can pause the application by clicking on the pause button, it will appear instead of the start button if the step count is started. Also, the user can reset the step count by pressing the reset button, after that all the collected data will be reset to zero and the user will be able to start counting steps again by pressing the start button.

#### Challenges:
When I started creating the application, the main challenge was to get acquainted with all the functionality that MIT app inventor provides. I also encountered a problem during testing that the application behaves incorrectly in some cases, but these problems were successfully solved.
